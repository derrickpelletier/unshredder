Image Unshredder
==========

Magical image unshredding!


## bonus_unshredder.py

This script takes an image that is shredded into uniform pieces and rearranged randomly. It will detect how wide the slices are and attempt to arrange them in proper order.

```python
python bonus_unshredder.py shredded/beach.png
```

This is my first Python script. It was done as quickly as possible for an Instagram developer challange. I'm likely missing some Python best practices or something.

Images can be shredded with shredder.py
```python
python shredder.py originals/beach.png
```
