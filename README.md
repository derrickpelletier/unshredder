Image Unshredder

Magical image unshredding


bonus_unshredder.py

This script takes an image that is shredded into uniform pieces and rearranged randomly. It will detect how wide the slices are and attempt to arrange them in proper order.
	python bonus_unshredder.py shredded/beach.png

This is my first Python script. It was done as quickly as possible for an Instagram Developer Challange. I'm likely missing some Python best practices or something.

Images can be shredded with shredder.py
